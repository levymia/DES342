        <p>Pope John Paul II was the head of the Catholic Church and 
            sovereign of the Vatican City State from 1978 until his 
            death in 2005. He was elected pope by the second papal 
            conclave of 1978, which was called after John Paul I, who 
            had been elected in August to succeed Pope Paul VI, died 
            after 33 days. Cardinal Wojtyła was elected on the third 
            day of the conclave and adopted the name of his 
            predecessor in tribute to him. Born in Poland, John Paul 
            II was the first non-Italian pope since Adrian VI in the 
            16th century and the second-longest-serving pope after 
            Pius IX in modern history.</p>

        <p>He was one of the most travelled world leaders in history, 
            visiting 129 countries during his pontificate. As part of 
            his special emphasis on the universal call to holiness, he 
            beatified 1,340 and canonised 483 people, more than the 
            combined tally of his predecessors during the preceding</p>

        <p>five centuries. By the time of his death, he had named most 
            of the College of Cardinals, consecrated or co-consecrated 
            many of the world's bishops, and ordained many priests. He 
            has also been credited with helping to end Communist rule 
            in his native Poland as well as the rest of Europe.</p>

        <p>Karol Józef Wojtyła was born on May 18, 1920, in Wadowice, 
            Poland, the youngest of three children. Although he was 
            born into a loving family, his early life was marked by 
            suffering and loss. His older sister, Olga, died in infancy 
            and, by the time Karol was twelve, his mother Emelia had 
            died of kidney failure and his older brother, Edmund, had 
            died heroically serving those stricken</p>

            growing under the loving guidance of his father, he was 
            a vibrant youth, athletic, studious and a gifted theatrical 
            performer. 

            In mid-1938, Wojtyła and his father left Wadowice and moved 
            to Kraków, where he enrolled at the Jagiellonian University.

            though required to participate in compulsory military training 
            in the Academic Legion, he refused to fire a weapon. He performed 
            with various theatrical groups and worked as a playwright. During 
            this time, his talent for language blossomed, and he learned as 
            many as 15 languages — Polish, Latin, Italian,</p>
